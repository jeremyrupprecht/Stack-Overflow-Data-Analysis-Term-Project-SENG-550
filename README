Stack-Overflow-Data-Analysis-Term-Project-SENG-550

Stack Overflow is a forum website that allows users to both ask technical questions and reply with answers to questions asked by other users. This project uses a limited selection of Stack Overflow questions and responses to build and train a Linear Regression model to predict the expected time for an answer to a question to be posted.

Created as a term project for SENG 550.
